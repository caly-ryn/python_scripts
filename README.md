# My Python Scripts

## Intent:

Here will be my big and small Python scrips. The first to be added is my takeabreak.py.

## takeabreak.py

- Packages: time, webbrowser, and OS.
- Purpose: every 45 the script will pull up the website randomgoat.com to remind me to take a break/stand up/etc. Why randomgoat.com? Because I Googled it as a joke, and it just so happened to be a website that load a new gif of goats every time it is refreshed or opened. Maybe a seaturtle or puppy version will be coming next.
- How to use: download the script and run it. After running, it will repeate every 45 minutes, 7 times total. The script currently opens Safari, and closes it after 18 seconds of goat videos.
- Limitations: This script is not automated to run on start up of your device. It has to be manually run by you unless you add it to your start up flow. Additionally, if you have any other Safari tabs open, it will close all of them, not just the goats tab. One work around is to add mouse controls to the script to close just the single tab, however, since I use Chrome usually, having Safari pop up and terminate independently does not hurt my workflow.
